# Software Design

The software design in Zomavan is under constant iteration.

This allows for our work to constantly evolve, incorporate new ideas, and create separation and abstraction where necessary, while not restricting us to following a particular architectural software design pattern which may not fit our business or engineering needs.

While we want to evolve our understanding at all times, we must be aware that we can only work as a team if our understanding is as aligned as possible; i.e. Software design patterns are only "patterns" because they are oft-reused and well-understood.

We want to make sure that each introduced concept is shared with, understood by, and usable by the team, so must be wary of introducing too many new concepts, potentially overwhelming the team.

## Components

Some high level architectural constructs used in Zomavan include:
